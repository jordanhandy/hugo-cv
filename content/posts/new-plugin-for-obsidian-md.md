Hi all,

I recently released my first attempt at an Obsidian plugin.  [The Obsidian Cloudinary Uploader](https://github.com/jordanhandy/obsidian-cloudinary-uploader) plugin allows you to upload your pasted images directly to your Cloudinary account.

You'll need your Cloudinary "Cloud Name", as well as an Upload Preset accepting unsigned uploads.  You can get the Plugin through the Github repo, or from the Obsidian Community Plugins page

As mentioned, this is my first attempt at a plugin, so I took heavy inspiration from @Kir 's Imgur Plugin.  My plugin is brand new, but I hope to have it evolve to take advantage of more of Cloudinary's inherent features as well.
