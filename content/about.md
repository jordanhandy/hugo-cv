My name is Jordan Handy. I hold a degree in Computer Science, from the School of Computing, at Queen's University, in Kingston, Ontario, Canada. I feel most at home with web development, and software analysis. I also have skills in both technical and creative writing. I have a passion for music production, and like tinkering with various electronics. I tackle my everyday problems with perseverance and tact. I complete tasks efficiently and effectively. Please take a look around my website, and feel free to contact me if you have employment opportunities, or are seeking a consultant.
